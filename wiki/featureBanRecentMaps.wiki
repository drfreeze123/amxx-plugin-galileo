#summary Feature Spotlight: Banning Recent Maps

----
= Description =

  Banning recently played maps means that the last several maps that have been played can not be nominated or otherwise placed in the map vote. This ensures that a map can not be played over and over again at the expense of playing a variety of other maps.

----
= Related CVARs =

  == gal_banrecent <<sub>[cvarNotations i]</sub>mapCount> ==
  Specifies how many of the most recent maps are disallowed from a map vote. 

  A value of "*0*" will disable this feature.

  Default value is "*3*".

  There is a cap defined by the "MAX_RECENT_MAP_CNT" constant in the SMA. It is set to "*16*" by default. It's not recommended but it can be safely changed if needed. The value of this CVAR needs to be less than or equal to the value of "MAX_RECENT_MAP_CNT".

  == gal_banrecentstyle <<sub>[cvarNotations i]</sub>style> ==
  Indicates the style in which the recent maps are displayed when a player uses the "*recentmaps*" say command.
{{{
1 - all maps on one line
2 - each map on a separate line
}}}
  Default value is "*1*".
