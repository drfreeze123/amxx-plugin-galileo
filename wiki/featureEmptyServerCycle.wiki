#summary You may have a lot of maps but only a few are sure to attract a lot of players. When the server is empty, you may want the server to change to those maps.

  == gal_emptyserver_wait _<<sub>[cvarNotations i]</sub>minutes>_ ==
  Specifies how many minutes to wait when the server is empty before changing to an alternate empty-server map cycle.

  A value of "*0*" will disable this feature.

  Default value is "*0*".

  == gal_emptyserver_mapfile _<<sub>[cvarNotations c]</sub>filename>_ ==
  Specifies the file which contains a listing of maps, one per line, to be used as the map cycle when the server is empty.

  When set to a filename without a path, it assumes the file is in the game mod folder (i.e. *"cstrike/mapcycle.txt"*). You can specify a relative path from your game mod folder before the filename to use files located elsewhere (i.e. *"/addons/amxmodx/configs/mapcycle.txt"*).

  Default value is *"emptycycle.txt"*.
