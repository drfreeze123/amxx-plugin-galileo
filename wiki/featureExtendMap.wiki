#summary Feature Spotlight: Extending the Map

----
= Description = 
  Allowing an extension of the current map's time limit will add an "extend the map" option to map votes which, if the option wins, will increase the time limit by a predetermined amount, letting players stay on the current map longer.<br />

----
= Related CVARs =
  == amx_extendmap_step <<sub>[cvarNotations f]</sub>minutes> ==
  Specifies the number of minutes a map will be extended each time the "_Extend Map_" option wins the map vote.

  Default value is "*15*".

  This is the same CVAR that AMXX provides. It is duplicated in this plugin because Galileo is responsible for handling it.

  == amx_extendmap_max <<sub>[cvarNotations f]</sub>minutes> ==
  Specifies the maximum number of minutes a map can be played, if it has been extended. A value less than "*mp_timelimit*" will not let the map be extended.

  Default value is "*90*".

  This is the same CVAR that AMXX provides. It is duplicated in this plugin because Galileo is responsible for handling it.

  == mp_timelimit <<sub>[cvarNotations f]</sub>minutes> ==
  Specifies the number of minutes a map can be played, without it being extended.

  Setting it to "*0*" will let the map be played indefinitely.

  Default value is "*20*".

  This CVAR is not provided by this plugin. It is only being listed here as a reference since the value of it directly relates to this feature.
