= Introduction =

This feature allows you = Details =

Here is an example of 3 counts listed:
{{{
3
3
2
}}}

The counts should not total more than the number of maps you allow in the vote. In the case of this example, the counts add up to 8 (3+3+2=8), which happens to be the maximum number of maps that can be allowed in a vote.

Since I've listed three different counts, I'll need 3 different files to keep my map listings in.

The files must be named and located as such:
{{{
./amxmodx/configs/galileo/1.ini
./amxmodx/configs/galileo/2.ini
./amxmodx/configs/galileo/3.ini
}}}
Each of those files, *1.ini*, *2.ini*, and *3.ini*, should contain a listing of maps [fileMapcycle_txt#In_the_Style_of... in the style of] *mapcycle.txt*.

Galileo will first load any nominated maps into the vote. It will then grab up to 3 maps from *1.ini*, up to 3 from *2.ini*, and up to 2 from *3.ini*.

= Map Load Order =

Maps will be loaded according to the order below until the maximum number of maps has been loaded as specified by *gal_vote_mapchoices*.
  # nominated maps
  # maps from vote fill groups
  # maps specified by *gal_vote_mapfile*
