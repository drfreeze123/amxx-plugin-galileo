#summary Definitions of notations found when CVARs are referenced.

When CVARs are listed, they are in one of the following formats:

  <,,f,,cvarValueDescription>
  [,,f,,cvarValueDescription]

Sometimes, instead of a single CVAR value description there'll be two or more separated by a vertical bar. This means you have a choice of which description to use.

  <,,f,,cvarValueDescription1|,,f,,cvarValueDescription2>
