#summary Explanation of notations found when CVARs (and commands!) are defined.

When CVARs are listed, they are in one of the following formats:

  <,,f,,cvarValueDescription>
  [,,f,,cvarValueDescription]

Sometimes, instead of a single CVAR value description there'll be two or more separated by a vertical bar. This means you have a choice of which description to use.

  <,,f,,cvarValueDescription1|,,f,,cvarValueDescription2>

{{{
f Floating Point Number (decimal)
i Integer Number
c String
| or
< > required
[ ] optional
}}}
