When CVARs are listed, they are in one of the following formats:

> <<sub>f</sub>cvarValueDescription>
> [<sub>f</sub>cvarValueDescription]

Sometimes, instead of a single CVAR value description there'll be two or more separated by a vertical bar. This means you have a choice of which description to use.

> <<sub>f</sub>cvarValueDescription1|<sub>f</sub>cvarValueDescription2>

```
f Floating Point Number (decimal)
i Integer Number
c String
| or
< > required
[ ] optional
